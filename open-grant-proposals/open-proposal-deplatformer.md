# Open Grant Proposal: `Deplatformer`

**Name of Project:** Deplatformer

**Proposal Category:** `core-dev` (Deplatformer), `devtools-libraries` (Pygate)

**Proposer:** peterVG

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** Yes

# Project Description
**The problem we are trying to solve with this project:** Currently, people across the world are facing a dire choice: continue to buy-in to social media platforms, accepting their ever-changing, draconian terms, along with the secretive sale of your private data to advertisers, **or** lose all your photos, data, and curated content to walled garden lock-in. Our aim is to create a clear use case and application of the Filecoin storage network which will allow users to deplatform and divorce themselves from Facebook and other centralized social networks. 

**What exactly are we planning to build:** Deplatformer will start with a modest goal, which will be to empower users to upload their Facebook content into Filecoin and regain control of their own curated data. We will establish a Filecoin Management Service that will let users control their liberated data on the Filecoin network.

This project will create the foundation for several other related initiatives. Firstly, it is our goal to integrate the Phase 1 deliverables into a mobile application that will allow users to share the images and videos liberated with Deplaformer via other messenger applications on their phone. We also plan to add self-deplatforming from other silos such Instagram, Google Photos, and iCloud. Lastly,  weâ€™ll investigate the ability to apply AI image classification and other methods to enable users to create their own value from their content collections.


**How our solution is going to adequately solve this problem.** We will minimize risk by focusing on the Facebook export and Filecoin Management Service use cases in order to develop the critical Filecoin tooling and workflows. These will be portable beyond the scope of this current project phase as well as to other projects in the Filecoin ecosystem to establish proven practices for moving cloud and platform data onto Filecoin. Most importantly, this specific focus will help us explore the relative market demand for this class of product.


## Value

**Why this proposal is valuable for the Filecoin ecosystem:** The most recent self-reported 2020 statistics show that Facebook had 2.7 billion monthly active users and Instagram had 1 billion monthly active users. Both Google Photos and iCloud are estimated to have over 1 billion users each. The recent Netflix documentary "The Social Dilemma" illustrated that there is growing concern within this user base about the mental health consequences, social decay, and loss of privacy that these platforms have introduced. Even if Deplatformer manages to convince just a small fraction of this market to give the decentralized storage alternative a try, it will represent a huge on-ramp of early adopter consumers for the Filecoin network.

Additionally the tools and practices we will develop and open-source as part of this project will be portable and greatly beneficial to many other Filecoin projects, specifically the Filecoin Management Service and the ability for mobile application clients to receive data pushed from Filecoin and IPFS.

**The benefits to getting this right:** Deplatformer will establish Filecoin as the go-to platform for repatriating online sovereignty. This is one of the core objectives of the decentralization movement and it will place Filecoin right at the forefront of it.

**The risks of not getting it right:** AI-driven advertising algorithms and feed manipulation logic will continue to improve exponentially as social media networks and centralized storage platforms increase their stranglehold on personal and civic sovereignty. 

**The risks that will make executing on this project difficult:** We must be able to convince a key early adopter community of users that giving Deplatformer a try will be worth it. We also must get Filecoin management right. We have to figure out the right balance between long-term cold-storage on Filecoin and making media available just-in-time to end-users. For example, there are no clear best practices established yet on when, where and how to make retrieval deals or if and when to cache in a hot layer. We have identified these risks and plan to address them head-on as part of our development plan.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans
Our goal is to transform into an open organization focused on providing the online world the ability to deplatform themselves from incumbent social media. Our plan is to use this amazing Filecoin open grant opportunity to launch and grow a free and  open sourced suite of Filecoin based tools and services. 

While our objectives are ambitious, we believe that by bootstrapping on the same networks we are liberating users from, and by providing them with a straight-forward user experience, we will be able to grow a critical mass of early adopters. The end-user web and mobile applications will remain free. However, we believe that after an initial period of subsidized Filecoin storage, whereby our users will gain increasing exposure and trust of the service, they will be willing to pay a small monthly subscription, on par or less than Google Drive or Apple iCloud storage. These fees will fund their Filecoin storage and the fractional micropayments we will charge to use the Deplatformer Filecoin Management Service. We will make all Filecoin storage, retrieval, and processing fees visible via reports in the web application so that users become educated and empowered users of the Filecoin network and the Deplatformer service.

In short, our long-term objectives to fund ongoing maintenance and upgrades include leveraging the initial product to begin collecting monthly service fees and transaction micropayments. We will also seek additional investments or assistance from cryptocurrency venture capitalists and grant programs.

As an additional benefit to the Filecoin community, we will also continue to maintain and develop the Pygate gRPC client to deliver the Deplatformer tools. This will keep the door open to the Filecoin world for the world's substantial and influential community of Python developers.

## Relevant Experience
Our team was chosen as one of ten finalists from over 130 projects in this past summerâ€™s HackFS event. We developed Pygate, the Python gRPC client and reference web application for Textileâ€™s Powergate API to the Filecoin network. It is now being actively used by other Filecoin projects that prefer to work in Python. Peter Van Garderen gave a developersâ€™ introduction to Pygate during Build day at the Filecoin Liftoff event. We continue to maintain Pygate for community benefit and we will enhance it as we use it to build out the Deplatformer web application and Filecoin Management Service.

Our team gained further experience developing Filecoin solutions by participating in the Gitcoin Apollo mentorship process as well as the Filecoin Slingshot competition. Our Deplatformer prototype was selected as one of the finalists in Apollo Demo Day and we were active, positive contributors in both the #powergate-users and #slingshot Slack channels during Slingshot Phase 1.

Our team includes deep technical expertise in blockchain, archiving, encryption technologies, and artificial intelligence research, as well as many years practical experience in systems administration, software development and IT community leadership.

# Additional Information
Our project members have a long history with blockchain technology and are passionate about the decentralization movement. We've gelled into a cohesive, effective team over the course of HackFS, Gitcoin Apollo and the Slingshot Space Race. Our skills and personalities are very complementary and we enjoy each other's company. We balance technical expertise with strong organizational skills to achieve our goals on time and within scope. Breaking down complex problems and then executing on them is our strong point, which is why the milestones above are both ambitious as well as realistic.  

The wider Filecoin community stands to benefit from our project deliverables irrespective of the relative success of the Deplatformer vision. However, We are confident that we will see Deplatformer come out of this seed phase with a concrete FOSS product suite that we will successfully launch and evolve through active engagement with our user base and sponsors. We will deplatform social media captives and lead the exodus to Filecoin decentralized storage!
